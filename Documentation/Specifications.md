## Purpose

### Introduction
Welcome to X50, where we believe in the extraordinary potential of every individual to live a long, happy, and fulfilling life. Our name, X50, symbolizes our vision of achieving 1050—10 WELLBYs multiplied by a life expectancy of 105 years, with no risks. This ambitious goal reflects our commitment to optimizing lifelong wellbeing for our members.

### Our Vision
At X50, we envision a world where everyone can measure and grow their lifelong wellbeing. We aim to empower individuals to take control of their health, happiness, and purpose, guided by a unique and actionable metric—LEWs (Lifelong Expected Wellbeing Scores), calculated by multiplying life expectancy, WELLBYs (measuring life satisfaction per year on a scale of 0-10) and an external risk factor number. By integrating life expectancy, WELLBYs, and risk adjustment, we provide a holistic view of wellbeing that is both measurable and achievable.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to be the trusted guide for lifelong wellbeing. We offer personalized insights, strategic coaching, community support, access to capital funding, business services, government services, and more to help our members optimize their LEWs. Through our innovative platform, we connect individuals with the tools and resources they need to make informed decisions that enhance their quality of life.
